# 20210821NJ-Karantias Burn

## Background

Charles would like us to impliment this algorithm so as to enable our
pro-burn comrads who would like to burn their tokens. Kostis, Aggelos,
and Dionysis wrote a paper on the topic, and I will attempt to
implement it.

## Compliance Considerations

I believe the only requirement is that I implement this algorithm
elegantly and completely. The primary properties are as follow:

> We propose the following properties for burn
> protocols. Unspendability, which mandates that an address which
> verifies correctly as a burn address cannot be used for spending;
> binding, which allows associating metadata with a particular burn;
> and uncensorability, which mandates that a burn address is
> indistinguishable from a regular cryptocurrency address. Our
> definition captures all previously known proof-of-burn protocols.

## Plan

Implement the burn-address generator and verifier.
