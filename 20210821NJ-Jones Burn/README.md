# 20210821NJ-Jones Burn

## Background

Charles would like us to impliment this algorithm so as to enable our
pro-burn comrads who would like to burn their tokens. While Kostis,
Aggelos, and Dionysis wrote a paper on the topic, I believe that I can
implement a more elegant version merely using the same model as that
which prevents an NFT from being generated more than once (using the
unique UTXO as being required for the retrieval of the coins in the
Plutus smart contract address via the redeemer just as the NFT could
not be again created.

## Compliance Considerations



## Plan

Let the validator require the UTXO used to spend the tokens at its
address be the same as the UTXO that created it.
